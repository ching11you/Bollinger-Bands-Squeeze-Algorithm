Fascinated by the increase in financial market volatility since the COVID-19 pandemicâ€”driven by rising inflation, monetary policy shifts and geopolitical tensions, I became deeply interested in identifying trading opportunities amidst this chaos. My research led me to explore various trading strategies, with a particular focus on those that are both unique and underexplored. This journey introduced me to the Bollinger Bands Squeeze Theory.

The Bollinger Bands Squeeze Theory measures the standard deviation of a security's price over a set period, visualised through upper and lower bands around a moving average. The theory suggest that when volatility contracts in a typically volatile security, causing the bands to tighten, a significant expansion in volatility is likely imminent. As the bands widen, the theory becomes an effective breakout predictor. By monitoring the width between the bands, I can establish a specific threshold that, once surpassed, triggers a signal. 

Initially, I explored the strategy using PineScript on TradingView, manually adjusting parameters for different securities through a trial-and-error approach to determine optimal settings. Through this experimentation, I realises the strategy performs particularly well in regimes where there is a volatile market downturn, most notably 2022, which I will be example period used in my code. Building on this experience, I transitioned to a more systematic approach using Python. I developed a grid search optimization technique to automate parameter selection, leveraging past experimental data to narrow down the most effective ranges. This evolution enabled comprehensive backtesting, not only revealing performance metrics but also identifying optimal configurations for a wide range of securities that was easily extracted from Yahoo Finance (yfinance).

I hope you find this strategy as compelling and innovative as I do!
